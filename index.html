        Thanks for checking out my web page! I'm Jacob and I'm stoked to be learning in the coding world. I've been in the bike industry for four years now, and have decided to take on a new challenge. I'm very driven by problem-solving, and the search for the fix tends to take over all of my thought. I'm very good at working alone, but I prefer to have a team with me, to balance out strengths and weaknesses, but also just for the camaraderie. Moreover, I'm an adaptive learner, I went from knowing how to change a tire on a bicycle, to something just shy of a shop manager in less than a year. I know this course will be difficult, but I believe I've had enough experience to persevere.

        <!-- Thanks for checking out my webpage! My name is Jacob and I've decided to write an about me instead of simply listing traits like I have on past resumes. My big passion in life is bikes, I guess I could say that it's the one trade I've developed in my time here on Earth. Being a GED recipient, I think it's cool that I found something that works for me. I've been in the bicycle industry for about 4 years now. While I do love it, I'm looking for something new, something challenging. So far bikes seem very similar to coding. Sometimes things dont work, and you have to look at seemingly unrelated parts at times to fix the issues. Sometimes you have to do very obvious things as well. I enjoy the puzzle and the hunt for fix, the final peice. Outside of work, I enjoy riding bikes, mainly mountain bikes, camping, hiking, being a food and drink snob, and driving my 4runner into the wild. Yep, that's my ride up there looking super majestic. To the right there is me! Big Chillen. In all seriousness, I'm very much so looking forward to starting a bootcamp, and hope this is a good fit. -->
